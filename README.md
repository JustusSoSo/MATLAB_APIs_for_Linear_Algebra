# MATLAB_APIs_for_Linear_Algebra
Some functions to calculate when learning on course on linear algebra.

## 1. API01_Row_Operation

It contains a "Matrix Input" script with GUI.
It is a script containing codes that give some windows for you to input a specified Mat and it'll be saved temporarily.
You just apply `SC01_Input_Matrix.m ` this file and everything's done.
You can then degrade a mat into Echelon Form.

## 2. API02_Invert_Matrix

It contains a "2x2 Matrix Input" script and an approach to invert this matrix.
You can also solve a Ax=b system with the inverted matrix.
